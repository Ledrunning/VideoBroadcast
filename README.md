# VideoBroadcast
Video broadcasting via RTP/RTSP or HTTP using VLC library *libvlc* and VlcDotNet wrapper
from [ZeBobo5](https://github.com/ZeBobo5/Vlc.DotNet).

Tested with libvlc 3.0.3 and 3.0.4 and last dev Nuget from ZeBobo5 - 3.0.0-develop296

It is necessary to copy libvlc -> win-x86 | win-x64 to the bin Debug or Release folder of your project
